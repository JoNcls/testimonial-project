<h1>💬 Testimonial Cards Project</h1>

<p>This project is based on the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/testimonial-cards" target="_blank">Testimonial Cards</a> challenge from <strong>roadmap.sh</strong>.</p>

<h2>🤖 Why I Built This</h2>
<p>
  I created this project with the help of AI, mainly as a way to experiment, play around, and fill my portfolio with simple UI components.
  I'm not planning to submit this to roadmap.sh because I respect their goal of supporting those who are genuinely learning by doing things from scratch.
</p>
<p>
  While this isn’t handcrafted line-by-line manually, the learning still happens—I explore code, understand how it works, and tweak things with intent. 
  You could say this is my own blend of <em>learning by collaborating with AI</em>. 🤝
